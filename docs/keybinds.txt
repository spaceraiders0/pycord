Pycord has several keybindings that you can use, and configure. Many are similar
to Discord's built in keybindings, however many changes have been made, as this
is inspired by Vim, which has quite efficient keybinding choices. Since Pycord
is based off commands, the keybinding you choose simply acts as a shortcut to a
command you would normally execute in the command-bar.
