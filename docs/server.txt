This section will discuss how the actual daemon works. To start, the daemon is the process
that is actively juggling information, and responding to requests from clients. When the
daemon is started, it will actively listen on a specific port for requests. These requests
come from individual clients that display the information sent by the daemon. Each request
is enqueued into a Queue. This is so each request will eventually be processed, even if it
hypothetically takes a while to complete. This does, however, allow for the daemon to be
controlled remotely. This means that to perform certain actions, you have no need to start
a client, and can instead send requests to the server yourself. You could also use the Client
interfaces to control it through your own Python script.

The server has various sub-modules that modify how it works. They are the following:
- workspaces.py
- settings.py
- authentication.py

------ Workspaces ------
Workspaces are essentially a way for you to view multiple discord channels at once.
Currently, they cannot be used to login to individual users. You browse your various
workspaces by pressing keys One, through Nine. By default, they do not have a channel
open. You must select one your self.

------ Settings ------
Settings are quite self explanatory. This file contains the settings for your client.
The syntax for the settings is actually quite simple. To set a setting's value, do the
following:

set setting_name value

------ Authentication ------
The authentication module handles logging into Discord. It exposes the interfaces used
by the daemon.
