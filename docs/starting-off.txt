Hello! Thank you for taking the time to read the documentation (or at the very least, this
specific file) of this Discord client!

To start off, it is important to acknowledge some things. Firstly, the use of this client
*is* against the Terms of Service that Discord currently has. By using this client, you need
to be aware of the fact that you **are** putting your account at risk of deletion. I feel that
this should go without saying, but I am not responsible for your account. Now with that out
of the way, I will move on to information regarding the client itself.

This client has features rooted in several other command-line applications. It is is heavily
inspired by Vi/Vim and features like windows are inspired from Cmus. This uses the Curses
library to draw the user interface. It is designed to be both modular, customizable, and
intuitive to use. Something special about this client, however, is that it is based off a
daemon (pycord). This means that you can have the actual server running in the background,
and pull off magic like running the server in the background, and running it across different
workspaces if you are using a standalone window manager. Now that the client itself is covered,
we can move on to how to use it.
