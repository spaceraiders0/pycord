Pycord has quite an easy to understand display management system. While it is not as
robust as something like Vim, or Tmux, I do feel that it is at least somewhat intuitive.

Pycord's display is centered on containers. The root of the display is the Screen.
The Screen contains columns, which contain windows. 

The screen is separated into columns, which are in turn separated by windows.
The columns determine the size of each window on the X axis, while the windows
themselves store their individual height. Since the dimensions of all screen
components are stored in variables, they can be modified dynamically at runtime.
In the future, this could allow for features such as window resizing. 

Windows are a bit more complex than columns. As stated previously, windows store
their height 


Each window can either be in one of two states. Focused, or unfocused. Commands
that operate on specific windows will operate on the window currently in focus.
Each window can also draw information from a specific workspace. The current
workspace is held in a variable, so this is what allows for you to switch between
workspaces and have it update so quickly.
